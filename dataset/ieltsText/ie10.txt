It is irrefutable; safety at work is must; and in a plethora of nations they have rigorous safety rules and regulations such as wearing safety shoes, and safety attiers, while working at factories. 
In my opinion, these safety laws should be made mandatory around the globe.  Firstly, this essay will demonstrate why safety laws are indispensable and secondly, what other safety rules can be commenced to ensure safety.

On the one hand, financial benefit is one of the evident perks of having safety laws in a country; moreover, this advantage will profit not only the workers but also the government. 
While the developed countries have already implemented strict safety laws, the developing nations are also pondering to introduce new and hard laws to ensure safety. 
For instance, in Canada, an obligation on the factories to make sure that their employees must ware hard caps and other safety gears, but in Thailand, it is not mandatory. 
Therefore, if these safety clothes help to avoid injuries, it is a good idea to introduce these laws around the world.

However, on the other hand, new and strict rules should be introduced to encourage safer environment to work. For this, first and foremost, workers should not be allowed to work more than eight hours; consequently, 
they would have good time to rest, and it will lead to higher focus at work, which will aid to get rid of the mishappening that happens due to lack of concentration and sleep. 

As per a survey by the "World Health Organization," fifty-four persent of accidents happen in small factories due to long hour of working.

To conclude, it is explicit from the paragraphs above; introducing safety laws is a good idea; further, these laws should be made mandatory for all the sates. 
Besides, I believe, new rules should be introduced to avoid accidents at factories such as monotring working hours.
