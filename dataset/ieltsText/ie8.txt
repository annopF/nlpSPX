There are people who says that it is easy to judge persons culture and character by their way of dressing. However, I completely disagree with this thought because people in this modern era are wearing different types of dresses 
as well as they are adapting new life style from other cultures.

As a result of globalisation, people are travelling to many countries thus, people are getting chances to wear wide variety of clothes which totally different from their culture.For instance, 
In India, until, few decades people used to wear dhotis but now people are wearing suits and jeans it is because of globalisation and modernisation. Therefore, it is impossible to predict anyone's character by their 
way of dressing style, even if we predict there is high chances of getting wrong.

Furthermore, people are adapting new culture from other cultures because of the influence of television and internet.For example, last year, one of the grand festivals in India name called 
"Holi" was celebrated in the streets of California, United states.Thus, it clearly illustrated that people are started to celebrate different festivals from other cultures, so how come we can predict ones 
culture by their choice of clothes.

To conclude, people are traveling to different palce for various purposes and adapting new dressing style and culture from foreign land.Therefore, it is impossible to predict ones character and culture 
by their way of dressing.Even if we judge the people by it is their choice of clothes it might be wrong.
